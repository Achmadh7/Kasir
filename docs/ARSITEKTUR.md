# Kasir Architecture

This document summarizes the technical decisions behind Kasir (a PlayStation rental billing app): code structure, data model, billing rules, payment and stock flow, notifications, theming, signing, CI, and testing — so a developer (or future me) can understand the app without reading all of the code from scratch.

## Overview

- A single-activity Android app (`MainActivity`); the entire UI is Jetpack Compose.
- 100% offline: all data lives in a local Room database; no network, accounts, or server.
- No ViewModel: composables read DAO `Flow`s directly (`collectAsState`) and write through `rememberCoroutineScope`. Pure calculation logic is separated into `Billing.kt` so it can be unit tested.
- Navigation is a `HorizontalPager` over the four tabs (Unit, Snacks, Reports, More): users swipe between tabs and dock taps animate to the target page, with the header and dock following the visible page. The Unit Management screen still replaces the main shell via `AnimatedContent` with Material 3 Expressive spring transitions while open.

## Code structure

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `MainActivity.kt` | `KasirApp` (shell, floating navigation dock, theme state, time-up popup), the Unit tab (unit rows, reservations card), and the Start Session / Session Detail / Checkout dialogs |
| `Screens.kt` | The session & snack receipt dialogs + share texts, the Snacks tab (steppers + batch payment with editable quantities), the Reports tab (7-day chart + composition), the More tab (store header, About dialog), and the Unit Management screen |
| `Billing.kt` | Pure logic: elapsed time, package remaining/end, rental cost, reservation & low-stock helpers, currency/date formatting |
| `SessionAlarm.kt` | AlarmManager scheduling (session warning/end, reservation reminders), the notification receivers incl. snooze, and the boot rescheduler |
| `Theme.kt` | The W2 steel-blue light/dark colour schemes for `MaterialExpressiveTheme` |
| `data/Models.kt` | The seven Room entities |
| `data/AppDatabase.kt` | `KasirDao`, `AppDatabase`, `DatabaseProvider` (singleton) |

## Data model (Room, version 4)

| Entity | Table | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| `UnitEntity` | `units` | name (TV 01), console type (PS3/PS4/PS5) |
| `SnackEntity` | `snacks` | name, price, stock |
| `SessionEntity` | `sessions` | unit, mode (PAKET/OPEN legacy), start/end epochs, accumulated pause, package duration, package price, status (RUNNING/PAUSED/FINISHED), rental total, payment method & amount |
| `SessionSnackEntity` | `session_snacks` | session, snack, quantity, price at the time |
| `SnackSaleEntity` | `snack_sales` | snack, quantity, price, timestamp, payment method (direct sales from the Snacks tab) |
| `ReservationEntity` | `reservations` | unit + name snapshot, customer name, start epoch, duration minutes, agreed price |
| `ExpenseEntity` | `expenses` | name, amount, epoch — operating expenses; Reports subtracts them for the net-profit line |

Migrations: `MIGRATION_1_2` adds the package price (v2); `MIGRATION_2_3` adds the reservations table (v3); `MIGRATION_3_4` adds the expenses table (v4).

Prices are always stored as snapshots on the transaction rows, so changing a menu price never alters past records. Units no longer carry a typed hourly rate: `Billing.hourlyRateFor` maps the console type to a reference rate (PS3 5000, PS4 8000, PS5 10000) that is used only as a snapshot/fallback for legacy sessions — it is never displayed, because the operator types each session's price by hand.

## Billing rules (`Billing.kt`)

- Elapsed time = (end time or now) − start time − accumulated pause − the currently ongoing pause. Because it is computed from stored epochs, timers stay accurate even if the app is closed or the phone restarts.
- **Package (the only way to start a session)**: the operator picks a duration (cards for 30–300 minutes, or types it) and types a **flat price by hand**. Running past the package duration adds nothing. Adding time extends the duration and adds a manually typed extra price to the package price.
- **Open Billing (legacy)**: sessions created before the package-only change keep rate-based billing — billable minutes = elapsed time rounded **up** to 10-minute blocks, minimum 1 block; cost = hourly rate × billable minutes / 60, rounded to the nearest rupiah.
- Constants: `BLOCK_MINUTES = 10` (legacy), `PAKET_OPTIONS = 30..300` minutes, console types PS3/PS4/PS5, `LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD = 3`.
- Display helpers: `formatRupiah` (Rp1.500.000), `formatRupiahShort` for chart labels (96 rb, 1,5 jt), `formatMinutes`, `formatHms`, `paketEndEpoch` (start + pauses + package duration), and the period bounds `startOfDay` / `startOfWeek` (Monday) / `startOfMonth` used by Reports.

## Payment & stock flow

- Session checkout: total = rental total + session snacks total. Cash requires the tendered amount to be ≥ the total and shows the change; QRIS is always exact. The payment dialog leads with a navy band showing the total and two large Tunai/QRIS cards. After payment the session becomes FINISHED and a receipt is offered for sharing.
- Cancelling a session restores the stock of all of its snacks, then deletes the session and its snack rows.
- Direct sales in the Snacks tab: the user raises steppers on several items (capped by stock), then pays for all of them in one dialog (Cash/QRIS) where **quantities remain editable** — lowering a quantity to zero removes the row. Each item becomes one `SnackSaleEntity`, its stock is decreased, and a snack receipt dialog closes the sale.
- Snacks added to a session decrease stock immediately; lowering the quantity or cancelling the session returns it. Food is added from a catalog built into the session dialog's Makanan tab (no separate add dialog).
- Low stock: menus with stock ≤ 3 are listed by `Billing.lowStockSnacks`; the dock shows a count badge on the Makanan tab and the tab itself shows a warning card that opens the full list.

## Reservations

- The Unit tab shows its reservations as a two-column grid of compact mini cards (max 4 + "+N more") under a section title with a navy "+ Tambah" pill button; each mini card (time + unit, customer + package + price) carries a small trash icon and a navy "Mulai" pill that starts the session from that booking (layout RC6D). A reservation stores a snapshot of the unit name, the customer, the start time (date + time pickers), a package duration, and an optional price. The booking form is a full-screen page with a navy hero header and a bottom-pinned save button, not a dialog.
- Starting a reservation opens the Start Session form prefilled with its duration and price; starting deletes the reservation. A reminder notification fires 15 minutes before the start (see Notifications).

## Notifications & alarms (`SessionAlarm.kt`)

- While a package session runs, two alarms are scheduled with `AlarmManager`: a **warning 5 minutes before** the package end and the **end alarm** itself. Pausing cancels both; resuming or adding time reschedules them. When exact alarms are not permitted, the code falls back to `setAndAllowWhileIdle`.
- The end notification carries a **"Tunda 10 Menit"** (snooze) action. Posted-alert markers and snooze deadlines live in the `kasir_alarms` SharedPreferences keyed by session end time, so reconciliation or a restart never reposts the same alert; extending a session changes its end time and may legitimately alert again.
- Receivers re-validate against the database before posting (a finished session stays silent), notification taps open the session via an intent extra, and a `BootReceiver` reschedules everything after a restart. Reservation reminders work the same way, 15 minutes before the start.
- Permissions: `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (requested at runtime on Android 13+), `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`. The More tab has a "Tes Notifikasi" entry that posts a sample end notification.

## Preferences (SharedPreferences)

| File / key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kasir_prefs` / `dark_theme` | Dark-mode boolean; an absent key follows the system setting |
| `kasir_prefs` / `store_name` | Store name on receipts and in the More tab header (default "Rental PS") |
| `kasir_alarms` / `end_<id>`, `warn_<id>`, `snooze_<id>` | Notification dedupe markers and snooze deadlines (see Notifications) |

## Theme & design

- The **W2 "Biru Baja"** steel-blue schemes, hand-written in `Theme.kt` (light: primary `#2E5A88`, container `#D3E3F3`; dark: primary `#6FA8DC`, container `#1B3A5C`) with every surface-container role specified explicitly, and a warm amber tertiary for paused/low-stock accents. Brand bands (header, start-session hero, receipt totals, About) use navy `#16324F` in both modes. Reports (layout K2: LE3 hero + LF1 charts) keeps one primaryContainer hero card for the whole calculation above neutral surfaceContainerHigh chart and composition cards; the only warm accent is the orange snacks segment of the composition strip.
- Navigation uses a **floating dock** (`FloatingDock`): a shadowed `surfaceContainerHigh` capsule whose width hugs its content (NB1 layout): only the active tab shows its label, inside a filled `primary` pill that widens to fit the text (animated with `animateContentSize`); the other tabs are icon-only. Tab content gets 120 dp of bottom padding so nothing hides behind the dock.
- Unit rows are monochrome (one surface tone for every state); a running session shows a small status dot (pulsing in the last 5 minutes) and a monospace timer.
- UI language: Indonesian.

## Signing & R8

- The signing keystore is **not in the repo**: CI restores `kasir.p12` from the `KASIR_KEYSTORE_BASE64` Actions secret as the first build step. `signingConfigs.ci` in `app/build.gradle.kts` then uses it for both debug **and** release builds, so every CI APK carries the same signature and updates install over older builds. (The keystore file still exists in old git history; rotating it would change the app signature and force a reinstall, so it is kept and only its distribution is restricted.)
- R8 (`minifyEnabled` + `shrinkResources`) is enabled for both build types. `app/proguard-rules.pro` keeps the `id.kasir.app.data.**` package (Room loads `AppDatabase_Impl`/`KasirDao_Impl` reflectively by name) and the `SourceFile`/`LineNumberTable`/`Signature`/annotation attributes.

## CI (GitHub Actions)

The `.github/workflows/build.yml` workflow is `workflow_dispatch` (run manually), 10 steps:

1. Checkout
2. **Restore signing keystore** — decode the `KASIR_KEYSTORE_BASE64` secret to `kasir.p12`
3. JDK 17 (Temurin)
4. Install Android SDK 37 (`platforms;android-37.0`) + build-tools 36.0.0 via `sdkmanager`
5. Set up Gradle 9.3.1 (`gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v4`, caching on via `org.gradle.caching=true`)
6. **Unit tests** — `gradle :app:testDebugUnitTest`
7. Build the debug APK — `gradle assembleDebug`
8. Build the release APK — `gradle assembleRelease` (embeds the baseline profile from `app/src/release/generated/baselineProfiles/baseline-prof.txt`, so hot code paths are compiled at install time)
9. Upload the `app-debug-apk` artifact
10. Upload the `app-release-apk` artifact — the build to install for daily use

Note: always start a fresh **Run workflow**; *Re-run jobs* rebuilds the old commit.

## Testing

31 unit tests across two files run in CI on every build. `BillingTest` (26 tests) covers the pure logic in `Billing.kt`: currency and short-currency formatting, thousand grouping, block rounding, elapsed time including pauses, package billable minutes + legacy overtime, rental cost for both modes, remaining package time and `paketEndEpoch`, the next-reservation helper, the low-stock helper, day/week/month bounds, and hourly revenue buckets. `BackupFilesTest` (5 tests) covers the backup/restore JSON round-trip and the encrypted-backup envelope (detection, round-trip, wrong-password rejection).
